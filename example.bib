abstract = "GPU hardware and CUDA architecture provide a powerful platform to develop parallel algorithms. Implementation of heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms on GPUs are limited in literature. Nowadays developing parallel algorithms on GPU becomes very important. In this paper, NP-Hard Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) that is one of the combinatorial optimization problems is discussed. Parallel Multistart Simulated Annealing (PMSA) method is developed with CUDA architecture to solve QAP. An efficient method is developed by providing multistart technique and cooperation between threads. The cooperation is occurred with threads in both the same and different blocks. This paper focuses on both acceleration and quality of solutions. Computational experiments conducted on many Quadratic Assignment Problem Library (QAPLIB) instances. The experimental results show that PMSA runs up to 29x faster than a single-core CPU and acquires best known solution in a short time in many benchmark datasets."

abstract = "The quadratic assignment problem (QAP), one of the most difficult problems in the NP-hard class, models many real-life problems in several areas such as facilities location, parallel and distributed computing, and combinatorial data analysis. Combinatorial optimization problems, such as the traveling salesman problem, maximal clique and graph partitioning can be formulated as a QAP. In this paper, we present some of the most important QAP formulations and classify them according to their mathematical sources. We also present a discussion on the theoretical resources used to define lower bounds for exact and heuristic algorithms. We then give a detailed discussion of the progress made in both exact and heuristic solution methods, including those formulated according to metaheuristic strategies. Finally, we analyze the contributions brought about by the study of different approaches."

abstract = "Multi-start methods strategically sample the solution space of an optimization problem. The most successful of these methods have two phases that are alternated for a certain number of global iterations. The first phase generates a solution and the second seeks to improve the outcome. Each global iteration produces a solution that is typically a local optimum, and the best overall solution is the output of the algorithm. The interaction between the two phases creates a balance between search diversification (structural variation) and search intensification (improvement), to yield an effective means for generating high-quality solutions. This survey briefly sketches historical developments that have motivated the field, and then focuses on modern contributions that define the current state-of-the-art. We consider two categories of multi-start methods: memory-based and memoryless procedures. The former are based on identifying and recording specific types of information (attributes) to exploit in future constructions. The latter are based on order statistics of sampling and generate unconnected solutions. An interplay between the features of these two categories provides an inviting area for future exploration."

abstract="Optimal flight gate assignment is a highly relevant optimization problem from airport management. Among others, an important goal is the minimization of the total transit time of the passengers. The corresponding objective function is quadratic in the binary decision variables encoding the flight-to-gate assignment. Hence, it is a quadratic assignment problem being hard to solve in general. In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality. Hence, we were able to solve small problem instances extracted from real data with the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer.",
